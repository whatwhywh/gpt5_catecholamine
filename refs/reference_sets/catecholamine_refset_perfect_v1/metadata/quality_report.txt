# Quality Control Report - Perfect Edition

Report date: 2025-08-08 10:51:36

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Contamination Removal
- ✅ Removed DOPA decarboxylase from TDC set
- ✅ Removed non-decarboxylase proteins (AtoC) from negative set
- ✅ Moved misclassified sequences to appropriate categories

### 2. SadA Collection
- ✅ Added authentic SadA sequences from literature
- ✅ Collected additional bacterial aromatic amino acid decarboxylases
- ✅ Verified PLP-dependent domain presence

### 3. Negative Set Separation
- ✅ Separated into individual enzyme files (GAD, HDC, LDC, ODC)
- ✅ Removed sequence redundancy
- ✅ Ensured taxonomic diversity

### 4. HMM Model Construction
- ✅ Built separate models for TDC and SadA/AADC
- ✅ Performed ROC analysis for threshold determination
- ✅ Validated model performance

## Quality Metrics

### Positive Sequences
- TDC sequences: 52
- SadA/AADC sequences: 3
- TDC length range: 610-639 aa
- SadA/AADC length range: 470-506 aa

### Negative Sequences
- GAD sequences: 49
- HDC sequences: 45
- LDC sequences: 42
- ODC sequences: 46

## Validation Status
- ✅ All sequences are bacterial origin
- ✅ Length filtering applied (300-800 aa)
- ✅ Quality filtering applied (<5% ambiguous residues)
- ✅ Functional annotation verified
- ✅ Duplicates removed
- ✅ HMM models constructed and validated
- ✅ ROC analysis performed
- ✅ Thresholds determined
